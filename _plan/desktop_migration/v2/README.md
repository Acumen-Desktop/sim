# Sim AI Desktop V2 Migration Plan

## Overview

This V2 migration plan represents a synthesis of the best ideas from three independent planning approaches (Claude, Codex, and Gemini). The result is a bulletproof architecture that balances simplicity with extensibility, security with performance, and rapid MVP delivery with long-term sustainability.

## Core V2 Principles

### üéØ **Bulletproof MVP**

- Production-ready from day one

### üèóÔ∏è **Extensible Architecture**
- Generic block system with JSON descriptors
- Trait-based provider system for AI integration
- Modular design enabling future growth
- Clean separation of concerns

### üîí **Security First**
- Encrypted API key storage with Stronghold
- No sensitive data exposed to frontend
- Local-first data storage
- Minimal attack surface

### ‚ö° **Desktop Performance**
- Native Rust backend for system operations

- RequestAnimationFrame-based smooth updates

**Benefits:**
- No framework dependencies or build steps
- Optimal performance for each element type
- Maintainable vanilla JavaScript codebase

### 4. [Block System](v2-blocks.md)
**Generic, extensible block architecture with JSON descriptors**

**Key Features:**
- Data-driven block definitions in JSON
- Trait-based handlers in Rust
- Dynamic UI generation from descriptors
- Validation and error handling built-in

**Benefits:**
- Add new blocks without touching core code
- Consistent behavior across all block types
- Easy testing and community contributions

### 5. [AI Integration](v2-ai-integration.md)
**Secure, flexible AI provider system with local inference support**

**Key Features:**
- Universal provider trait supporting OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama
- Secure key management with Stronghold encryption
- Real-time streaming responses
- Automatic provider detection and model listing

**Benefits:**
- Support for both cloud and local AI models
- No vendor lock-in with provider abstraction
- Maximum security for sensitive API keys

### 6. [MVP Scope](v2-mvp-scope.md)
**Precisely defined feature set for bulletproof MVP delivery**

**MVP Features:**
- 6 core block types (start, condition, variable, template, HTTP, AI, file, output)
- Visual workflow editor with drag-and-drop
- Sequential execution with real-time progress
- Local storage with automatic backups
- Multi-provider AI integration

**Success Criteria:**
- < 3 second startup time
- < 5 minute time-to-first-workflow
- Zero data loss under normal operation
- 90th percentile performance targets

### 7. [Implementation Roadmap](v2-implementation-roadmap.md)
**12-week development plan with incremental delivery**

**Phase Structure:**
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3):** Foundation - Tauri setup, database, canvas basics
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 4-6):** Core blocks and execution engine
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 7-9):** AI integration and streaming
- **Phase 4 (Weeks 10-12):** Local models, polish, and release prep

**Delivery Model:**
- Working application at the end of each week
- Incremental feature additions
- Continuous validation against success criteria

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Technology Stack
```
Frontend:  Vanilla JavaScript + SVG/HTML (no frameworks)
Backend:   Rust + Tauri (native performance)
Database:  SQLite + Stronghold (local + secure)
AI:        Provider abstraction (cloud + local)
UI:        Direct DOM manipulation (no build steps)
```

### Design Trade-offs

**Chosen: Simplicity over Features**
- Focus on 6 core block types rather than 50+ advanced blocks
- Sequential execution rather than complex parallel processing
- Local-only rather than cloud collaboration

**Chosen: Reliability over Speed-to-Market**
- Comprehensive error handling from the start
- Extensive testing before each release
- Security-first architecture decisions

**Chosen: Extensibility over Convenience**
- Generic block system requires more upfront work
- Trait-based architecture has learning curve
- JSON descriptors add indirection

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Performance:** < 3s startup, 60fps interactions, < 100MB memory
- **Reliability:** < 0.1% crash rate, 0% data loss
- **Cross-Platform:** Windows, macOS, Linux support

### User Metrics
- **Usability:** < 5min to first workflow for new users
- **Adoption:** > 70% user retention within 7 days
- **Satisfaction:** > 4.0/5.0 average user rating

### Business Metrics
- **Support Load:** < 10% users need help with basic operations
- **Feedback Quality:** Clear feature prioritization from user requests
- **Growth Potential:** Architecture supports 10x feature expansion

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Canvas Performance:** Regular profiling checkpoints
- **Cross-Platform Issues:** Early testing on all targets
- **AI Provider Changes:** Abstraction layer protects against API changes
- **Data Corruption:** Comprehensive backup and recovery testing

### Product Risks
- **Feature Gaps:** Clear communication about MVP scope
- **User Expectations:** Built-in tutorials and examples
- **Learning Curve:** Focus on intuitive defaults and error messages

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Environment Setup:** Install Rust, Tauri CLI, and development tools
2. **Project Initialization:** Create Tauri project with planned directory structure
3. **Team Alignment:** Review architecture decisions and implementation plan
4. **Development Start:** Begin Phase 1 foundation work

### Success Validation
1. **Week 1 Checkpoint:** Basic Tauri app launches successfully
2. **Week 6 Checkpoint:** Complete workflow creation and execution
3. **Week 9 Checkpoint:** AI integration working end-to-end
4. **Week 12 Checkpoint:** Production-ready MVP with installers

## Conclusion

This V2 migration plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for transforming Sim AI from a complex web application into a simple, powerful desktop tool. By combining the best insights from multiple planning approaches, we achieve a rare balance: an architecture that is simple enough to ship quickly but sophisticated enough to grow sustainably.

The focus on bulletproof reliability, extensible architecture, and desktop-native performance ensures this MVP will not only deliver immediate user value but also provide a solid foundation for the future evolution of Sim AI Desktop.

# Gemini's Migration Strategy for Sim AI Desktop

## 1. Philosophy: A Phased and Pragmatic Fresh Start

We will execute a phased migration, building a new Tauri application from scratch. This "fresh start" approach, advocated by both Claude and Codex, allows us to build a lean, desktop-native application without the baggage of the web-first architecture. Each phase is designed to deliver a functional piece of the application, allowing for iterative development and testing.

## 2. The Phases of Migration

### Phase 1: The Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

*   **Goal:** Set up the basic Tauri project and establish the core architecture.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  Initialize a new Tauri project (`cargo tauri init`).
    2.  Set up the directory structure as defined in `gemini-architecture.md`.
    3.  Create the minimal HTML shell and CSS for the main layout.
    4.  Implement the basic IPC bridge (`ipc.js`) for frontend-backend communication.
    5.  Configure the Tauri window (`tauri.conf.json`) with default size and title.
    6.  Add core Rust dependencies: `tauri`, `serde`, `tokio`, `rusqlite`, `reqwest`, `thiserror`.

### Phase 2: The Data Layer (Weeks 3-4)

*   **Goal:** Implement the local database and data management.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  Implement the SQLite database schema as defined in `gemini-database.md`.
    2.  Create the Rust database module (`database.rs`) with functions for all CRUD operations on workflows, runs, and settings.
    3.  Implement the secure secrets management for API keys, using `tauri-plugin-stronghold` or a similar solution.
    4.  Expose Tauri commands for all database operations (e.g., `save_workflow`, `load_workflow`, `get_setting`).

### Phase 3: The Canvas (Weeks 5-6)

*   **Goal:** Build the visual workflow editor.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  Implement the SVG-based canvas as detailed in `gemini-canvas.md`.
    2.  Create the `WorkflowBlock` and `Connection` classes in JavaScript.
    3.  Implement pan, zoom, drag-and-drop, and connection creation.
    4.  Connect the canvas to the backend, so that workflows can be saved and loaded from the SQLite database.

### Phase 4: The Execution Engine (Weeks 7-8)

*   **Goal:** Implement the ability to run workflows.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  Implement the Rust-based workflow execution engine.
    2.  Create the generic block handlers for the MVP feature set (as defined in `gemini-mvp-features.md`).
    3.  Implement the `ai.chat` block, including the AI provider abstraction.
    4.  Set up the event-based streaming for real-time logging to the frontend.
    5.  Expose the `execute_workflow` Tauri command.

### Phase 5: UI and Polish (Weeks 9-10)

*   **Goal:** Build out the rest of the user interface and polish the user experience.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  Create the block palette and inspector panel.
    2.  Implement the settings screen for managing API keys and other preferences.
    3.  Refine the CSS and overall look and feel of the application.
    4.  Add user-friendly error handling and feedback.

### Phase 6: Testing and Deployment (Weeks 11-12)

*   **Goal:** Ensure the application is stable and ready for release.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  Conduct thorough testing on all target platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
    2.  Fix bugs and address any performance issues.
    3.  Create the application installers using `cargo tauri build`.
    4.  Write user documentation and prepare for the initial beta release.

## 3. Risk Mitigation

*   **Canvas Performance:** We will continuously profile the SVG canvas and optimize as needed, especially with large workflows.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** We will test on all target platforms from an early stage to catch any OS-specific issues.
*   **Scope Creep:** We will strictly adhere to the MVP feature set defined in `gemini-mvp-features.md` for the initial release.

This phased migration strategy provides a clear and manageable path to delivering a high-quality desktop application, balancing the need for a fresh start with a structured and iterative development process.
